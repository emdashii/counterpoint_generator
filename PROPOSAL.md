# Group Project: Music


## Problem Definition

The goal for this project is to build a program that generates correct two-voice counterpoint. 
This project has four distinct parts: a note class, a class/function that combines all the rules, classes of rules, and a class/function that outputs a .ly file. 

__Key Features__

* User chooses length, key, time signature, and species type.
* Follows all the rules for counterpoint.
* Outputs a LilyPond file with the created song.

__Assumptions__

The users of the system are good actors. 
The user will not want to write counterpoint in a minor key. 
The user cannot choose what notes they want.
