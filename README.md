# Coding Style Standards

> Commenting Conventions
 * For anything that is not done yet, is currently being worked on, or needs to be done, please mark with a //TODO comment; don't use //FIXME, as Visual Studio will recognize //TODO comments and format them differently and they will also show up in the task list explorer so it is easy to see what needs to be done and where etc.  Other recognized keywords are HACK, TODO, UNDONE, and UnresolvedMergeConflict.
 * To view the task list explorer, you can use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+\,T or go to the menu at the top and select view, then other windows, and then task list near the bottom.
 * Double clicking on any todo item in the task list will take you to the location of that item

> Naming Conventions
 * All standard variables will be named using camelCase
 * All classes will be named using UpperCamelCase
 * All global variables will be ALL_CAPS
 * Most all braces and indentations will follow K&R style
